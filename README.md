# MS_DataExploration

This repository contains the code and report for my Data Science master's program's Data Exploration course. It was basically a course on k-means and decision trees. I don't have the reviewing professor's feedback anymore but I know I got an A and a phrase like 'love your report' was used. Aw.

For the assignment we were given a bunch of telecomm customer data and asked to group high value customers to better understand what type of people they are. The report is a bit cheesy, but please don't hold that against me.
